# Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a 
# threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation 
# between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the 
# number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is 
# greater than the threshold. The function should return a 
# vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the 
# threshold requirement. If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, 
# then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0. A prototype of this function follows
